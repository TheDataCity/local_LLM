COMPANY HISTORY COMPANY HISTORY At F.S. Mackenzie we are proud of our long history in the UK which dates us back to 1951 in London’s East End. The very first F.S. Mackenzie team provided overland freight forwarding solutions for 1950s Britain as a UK domestic service provider. In the late 1990s the F.S. Mackenzie team were some of the first to set foot in several global markets offering sea, air and land logistics solutions. It is F.S. Mackenzie’s mission to venture into developing markets to offer new and competitive services to our customers. F.S. Mackenzie quickly grew to diversify, offering more comprehensive logistics services until the latter end of the 20th Century when F.S. Mackenzie entered the global arena. The company also became one of the largest privately-owned freight companies in the UK, expanding from being a UK based domestic provider to the well-established freight forwarder we know today. \u200b In the early 2000s F.S. Mackenzie opened our first fully dedicated air freight and road freight UK offices at London’s Heathrow and Dover ports. Here, each office - including Basildon HQ which offers sea freight services - has a dedicated expert team for all freight and logistics solutions. Since 2014 F.S. Mackenzie has operated under the ownership of Singapore Post Limited through Famous Pacific Shipping Group. Singapore Post as the country’s postal service provider, has been delivering trusted and reliable services to homes and businesses in Singapore. Today, at F.S. Mackenzie, we strive for development in order to offer you a simple but demanding promise: To provide you with the highest quality shipping services that are both proficient and punctual.

UK TAX STRATEGY UK TAX STRATEGY F.S. Mackenzie are international freight forwarders operating from the UK. \u200b INTRODUCTION \u200b In accordance with the requirements of paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016, F.S. Mackenzie Ltd. (FSM) presents its UK Tax Strategy. This tax strategy applies to all UK taxes applicable to the UK Company and has been approved by the Board of Directors of FSM. \u200b The policy will be reviewed annually. \u200b APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS FSM has a low appetite towards tax risk and as such all significant tax decisions are agreed by the Financial Controller and the Chief Financial Officer and reviewed, monitored and endorsed by the Board. FSM has clear tax policies, procedures and controls in place to meet the obligations of the Senior Accounting Officer legislation and are assessed through a central risk register. These are overseen by the Chief Financial Officer and Group Financial Controller and are monitored and reviewed by internal teams and tax specialists. As part of the continuous review of controls and procedures, the internal audit team examines areas of the business and its processes, including tax. External tax advisors are on hand to provide tax advice and confirmation where required, for example when new legislation is introduced or on areas of uncertainty. External tax advisors also review the UK Corporation tax returns before they are filed to HMRC. \u200b ATTITUDE TOWARDS TAX PLANNING \u200b When entering into commercial transactions, FSM seeks to take advantage of available tax incentives, reliefs and exemptions which are consistent with the spirit as well as the letter of the tax law and takes external advice to confirm this if necessary. \u200b THE LEVEL OF RISK IN RELATION TO UK TAXATION \u200b FSM seeks to comply fully with its regulatory obligations and ensures the tax arrangements are consistent with a low tax risk approach to conducting its business. \u200b FSM does not seek to structure transactions in ways that give tax results inconsistent with their underlying economic consequences. \u200b Where the tax treatment of any particular material transaction is uncertain, external tax advice will be sought before proceeding with the transaction. \u200b THE APPROACH TOWARDS DEALINGS WITH HMRC \u200b FSM’s approach to HMRC is transparent and constructive, resulting in a positive working relationship. FSM takes the initiative to raise with HMRC any doubtful or contentious issues. FSM engages on a real-time basis with HMRC to ensure compliance and create certainty for the company and for customers in respect of the indirect taxes of VAT, Customs and Excise. This proactive approach helps the Company and customers to comply with the HMRC requirement of “right duty at the right time”. Applies to financial year ending 2023. \u200b \u200b GET IN TOUCH sales.support@fsmac.com Click Here +44 (0) 1268 275555 We'd love to hear from you F.S.
